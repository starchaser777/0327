            <h2>Call Me Maybe - Carly Rae Jepsen</h2>
            <p>I threw a wish in the well
                Don't ask me, I'll never tell
                I looked to you as it fell
                And now you're in my way
                I trade my soul for a wish
                Pennies and dimes for a kiss
                I wasn't looking for this
                But now you're in my way
                Your stare was holdin'
                Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
                Hot night, wind was blowin'
                Where you think you're going, baby?
                Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe
                It's hard to look right at you, baby
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe
                Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe
                And all the other boys try to chase me
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe</p>

            <h2>woman on the hills - Issac Dunbar</h2>
            <p>Driving alone in my carTo a new place in town
                Decided to go to the park
                I saw a new girl around
                She told me to take the whole world by the throat
                Boy, you have something no one else has got
                You've got that perfect smile
                Yeah, it makes the boys and girls run for miles
                Click click, boom, be ready soon
                You've got a photo shoot at two
                With the girl who made you who you are
                Don't turn your back when you're near
                The woman on the hills
                Taking photographs of you
                Taking a hold of you
                Don't laugh or craft when you're near
                The woman on the hills
                She needs more from you
                She needs less of you</p>
